<h4>About this project</h4>
<p>
    A supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product to the final buyer.<br>
    This network includes different activities, people, entities, information, and resources.<br>
    The supply chain also represents the steps it takes to get the product or service from its original state to the customer.<br>
    Companies develop supply chains so they can reduce their costs and remain competitive in the business landscape.<br>
    Supply chain management is a crucial process because an optimized supply chain results in lower costs and a faster production cycle.
